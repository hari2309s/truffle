## The problem

Every finance app assumes you're rational about money. You're not. Nobody is.

Revolut shows you a red bar and you close the app. YNAB requires you to sit down and categorise 47 transactions. MoneyDashboard gives you charts you don't want to look at.

Truffle is different. Hold a button and ask *"how am I doing this month?"* — and get a calm, honest answer spoken back to you. No charts. No judgment. Just clarity.

---

## Features

- 🎙️ **Voice first** — hold to speak, get a spoken answer back
- 🧠 **Conversational reasoning** — ask anything about your finances in plain language
- 🔍 **Anomaly detection** — spots unusual charges and forgotten subscriptions automatically
- 📈 **Spending forecast** — tells you where you'll land at end of month
- 😌 **Emotionally aware** — calm, warm tone always. Never a lecture
- 📱 **PWA** — installs on iOS and Android, works offline

---

## How it works

```
You speak → Groq Whisper transcribes → LangGraph routes your intent
→ Gemini reasons over your actual transaction history (via RAG)
→ Response streams back → Web Speech API reads it aloud
```

Your transactions are embedded locally using `@xenova/transformers` and stored in ChromaDB — meaning the reasoning is grounded in your real data, not generic advice.

## Agent architecture

Truffle uses a LangGraph.js agent graph to route and reason over your financial data:

```
User query
    ↓
Intent Router         ← classifies what you're asking
    ↓
┌───┬───┬───┬──────┐
│   │   │   │      │
▼   ▼   ▼   ▼      ▼
Spending  Anomaly  Forecaster  Affordability
Analyst   Detector             Checker
│   │   │   │      │
└───┴───┴───┴──────┘
    ↓
Synthesizer           ← formats a calm, spoken response
    ↓
Spoken + displayed answer
```
